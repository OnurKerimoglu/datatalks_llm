Make sure you’re comfortable with the potential extra work this entails.\\n\\n5. **Evaluate Online or Recorded Options:** If the course is offered online or as a hybrid model with recorded lectures, you might have more flexibility to catch up.\\n\\nIf these options seem feasible, reach out as soon as possible to maximize your chances of enrolling.\""
